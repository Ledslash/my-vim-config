# Personal Vim Configuration
This is the usual configuration i use when i have vim installed withouth any plugin,
it's still under development as usual these things are always on constant change...

At some point i will try to give an explanation of the mindset i use during each of the things i use.
This is a fully development configuration.

I usually use Vundle for plugin installation but im almost sure you can use anything you like for it.
YCM needs some configuration and installation depending on the languages you use so i recommend looking up their
installation tutorial.

I should recheck for the other plugins i think they work right out of the bat, but i honestly do not remember; I'm almost sure
there's something specific to installing a colorscheme using NerdTree but i really don't remember anything about it
